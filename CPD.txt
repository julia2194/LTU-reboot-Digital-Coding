Relection

In today's lesson I learnt things aren't always straightforward but teamwork can get you through. 
I learnt how to download files from GitHub to Visual Studio and then edit the file. Also how to find other useful extensions I can use such as live server which I downloaded.

***** HELP NEEDED HERE *****
Just added a new file to repo in Github named Julia thought
I'd try and download to Visual Studio but can't work it out??? 
********************************************************

So far I have learnt the following workflow:

Create and name new repo in Github (browser)
Next clone to Github desktop to make it a local copy
Upload to Visual studio code for editing code
Make changes to relevant file in VSC and save
Back in Github desktop you should be able to view the changes to your file.
Add comments in GHD if required and commit to master
This shows file as local. Click push origin to  move to remote copy.
Go back to GH browser, refresh and check repo file shows changes.

I have downloaded Mimo to my phone and Freecodecamp to my laptop to do some practise coding.
