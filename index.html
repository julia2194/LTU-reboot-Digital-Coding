   <h2>Relection</h2> 
    
<p>In today's lesson I learnt things aren't always straightforward but teamwork can get you through. 
    I learnt how to download files from GitHub to Visual Studio and then edit the file. Also how to
    find other useful extensions I can use such as live server which I downloaded.</p> 
    
<p>***** HELP NEEDED HERE *****
    Just added a new file to repo in Github named Julia thought
    I'd try and download to Visual Studio but can't work it out??? 
    
    Updated my CPD file again wouldnt push as said had files sat on local not
    in remote and I had to fetch them, just kept clicking and eventually
    brought Julia file to VS. Need to understand this? How do I delete it now?
    tried it again and created another new file. Pulled it through to VS by clicking 
    pull in repository on GHD. Right clicked to delete file in VS!  
    
    I worked it out yeah..........
    ********************************************************</p> 
    
  <p>So far I have learnt the following workflow:
    
    Create and name new repo in Github (browser)
    Next clone to Github desktop to make it a local copy
    Upload to Visual studio code for editing code
    Make changes to relevant file in VSC and save
    Back in Github desktop you should be able to view the changes to your file.
    Add comments in GHD if required and commit to master
    This shows file as local. Click push origin to  move to remote copy.
    Go back to GH browser, refresh and check repo file shows changes.
    
    I have downloaded Mimo to my phone and Freecodecamp to my laptop to do some practise coding.

<h1>Reflection 1 10 20</h1>
><p> In today's lesson we learnt about the different environments i.e local which sits on Github Desktop 
    and production which sits on the live server.

</p>
<p>We looked at the workflow of a developer and talked about version control. We also looked at
    Branches and how they work. A branch is a copy of the main master file which can be worked on
    by an individual developer. If there are multiple developers they can all take copies of the master
    file into their branch and they upload back to the master when they have completed their task. Everytime
    a developer clones a copy of the master file they will have the most upto date copy with all changes made
    by all developers at that point.
</p>

<p>Next we created a html template. 
Luke showed us a short cut to establishing the first part of the html code by starting with a ! which established the
initial structure for the template. We learnt about body, title, h1 & h2 tags</p>

<p>The process flow of making changes in VS and then commiting ing GitHub desktop is now beginning to stick.
    change in VS, comment and commit in GHD.
</p>

<p>We also learnt how to open the html file in the live server by clicking on go live at the bottom
    of the VS page. It's important to close the server ater by clicking on Port555 and then save & commit in GHD.
</p>

<p> We looked at the structure of branches in Git and learnt how to create and publish a new branch in our existing
    repository. Also how to interchange between the master and the branch.

    We also changed our CPD txt file to a html file so we could see the page online.

    Doing this I established a problem as I got a 404 page. The error turned out to be that the index file had a 
    capital I instead of lowercase in VS, but then after committing it still brought up a 404. The capital I had
    carried over to the name in Github. Luke showed me how to rename the file in there and it worked!!!!

    I've enjoyed today as the small bits of html I know is now coming together. SAVE, COMMITT!!!!

<h1>Reflection 6 10 20</h1>
<p>
Yesterday we looked at HTML and the anatomy of a website and various tags and attributes.
Today we have continued with that looking at links and images.
we learnt about relative and absolute paths for links & images.
Learnt how to open links in page, open a new tab and open an email in 
default email client.

Learnt importance of using alt tags for images so that screen readers can describe what
the image is for people with impaired straightforward
We looked at different elements that can be used such as line break, lists, how to comment
in the file without it showing on web page, and also tables.

We then looked at CSS and CSS Rules. All this is now making more
sense for my own website. I like to amend my site using the code as my wordpress
theme doesn't always suit my requirments so this is making it easier now
I understand how it works.

We looked at the ways you can connect CSS to HTML and that the preferred way is to use the external
method as it shares the code across multiple pages whereas for example the inline only affects 1 page.
It is also easier to manage for larger projects.

The link to the CSS always goes in the html header text.

In addition we looked at values and properties.

I'm still enjoying the course and it's not as difficult, so far as I expected it to be. Perhaps due to me 
already knowing small amounts and having built my own site already.

Took W3 quiz got 85% (can't screen shot)

<h1>Reflection 7 10 20</h1>
<p>In today's lesson we learnt about CSS amends in style sheet which included embedding and other different elements

    We learnt about DRY - Don't repeat yourself. To reuse CSS we use Ids and Classes. Id relates to just 1 element
    whereas class relates to multiple elements.

    Cascading was also explained an the priority of each element. We also looked at some of the CSS properties

</p>

<h1>Reflection 8 10 20</h1>
<p>

Today's class covered Pseudo classes for CSS where special effects are added
to selectors. Next we learnt about th eBox Model. I was really interested to hear  the 
explanation of this as I've struggled to understand it when looking at my own website. This helped
me understand about the spacing and margins around content. We also looked at
positioning and layout of code.

I was feeling a bit frustrated and out of my depth at the beginnng of the lesson today as I'd missed
a lot of yesterdays so I struggled to make sense of some of it. Also Luke has now adopted the lesson to
actually do the code as he's talking us through it so making notes was more difficult as he was running 
through it fairly quickly. TOmorrow we have an extra lesson to do some more catching up.

Today I also caught up on the last 45 mins of yesterdays lesson as I had an appointment.

I learnt about inline vs block elements also about the element 
span and mark.

I felt better having watching the bit of the lesson I missed from yesterday as it made today's 
lesson more understandable.

<h1>Reflection 9 10 20</h1>
<p>
Today we learnt about Z index, float and clear elements. Also about frameworks. We demonstrated using
Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/

Took HTML quiz result 87% previously 85%  CSS quiz 64%

</p>

<h1>Reflection 15/10/20 </h1>
<p>Today we learnt about Loops, Arrays and Objects
it's getting quite complicated now. There's a lot of different brackets going on!!! I understand it now,however I'm 
wondering how I'm going to remember this all and pull it all together
</p>
