   <h2>Relection</h2> 
    
<p>In today's lesson I learnt things aren't always straightforward but teamwork can get you through. 
    I learnt how to download files from GitHub to Visual Studio and then edit the file. Also how to
    find other useful extensions I can use such as live server which I downloaded.</p> 
    
<p>***** HELP NEEDED HERE *****
    Just added a new file to repo in Github named Julia thought
    I'd try and download to Visual Studio but can't work it out??? 
    
    Updated my CPD file again wouldnt push as said had files sat on local not
    in remote and I had to fetch them, just kept clicking and eventually
    brought Julia file to VS. Need to understand this? How do I delete it now?
    tried it again and created another new file. Pulled it through to VS by clicking 
    pull in repository on GHD. Right clicked to delete file in VS!  
    
    I worked it out yeah..........
    ********************************************************</p> 
    
  <p>So far I have learnt the following workflow:
    
    Create and name new repo in Github (browser)
    Next clone to Github desktop to make it a local copy
    Upload to Visual studio code for editing code
    Make changes to relevant file in VSC and save
    Back in Github desktop you should be able to view the changes to your file.
    Add comments in GHD if required and commit to master
    This shows file as local. Click push origin to  move to remote copy.
    Go back to GH browser, refresh and check repo file shows changes.
    
    I have downloaded Mimo to my phone and Freecodecamp to my laptop to do some practise coding.

<h1>Reflection 1 10 20</h1>
><p> In today's lesson we learnt about the different environments i.e local which sits on Github Desktop 
    and production which sits on the live server.

</p>
<p>We looked at the workflow of a developer and talked about version control. We also looked at
    Branches and how they work. A branch is a copy of the main master file which can be worked on
    by an individual developer. If there are multiple developers they can all take copies of the master
    file into their branch and they upload back to the master when they have completed their task. Everytime
    a developer clones a copy of the master file they will have the most upto date copy with all changes made
    by all developers at that point.
</p>

<p>Next we created a html template. 
Luke showed us a short cut to establishing the first part of the html code by starting with a ! which established the
initial structure for the template. We learnt about body, title, h1 & h2 tags</p>

<p>The process flow of making changes in VS and then commiting ing GitHub desktop is now beginning to stick.
    change in VS, comment and commit in GHD.
</p>

<p>We also learnt how to open the html file in the live server by clicking on go live at the bottom
    of the VS page. It's important to close the server ater by clicking on Port555 and then save & commit in GHD.
</p>

<p> We looked at the structure of branches in Git and learnt how to create and publish a new branch in our existing
    repository. Also how to interchange between the master and the branch.

    We also changed our CPD txt file to a html file so we could see the page online.

    Doing this I established a problem as I got a 404 page. The error turned out to be that the index file had a 
    capital I instead of lowercase in VS, but then after committing it still brought up a 404. The capital I had
    carried over to the name in Github. Luke showed me how to rename the file in there and it worked!!!!

    I've enjoyed today as the small bits of html I know is now coming together. SAVE, COMMITT!!!!
