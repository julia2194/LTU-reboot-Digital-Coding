1. Reading list

keep track of what books I have read & ones I have not read
Create an ARRAY of OBJECTS

BOOK TITLE = 'string'
AUTHOR = 'string'
hasRead = boolean - true

    [
        {TITLE = 'The Hobbit', 
        AUTHOR = 'J R R Tolken',
        hasRead = true
        },

         {TITLE = 'Harry Potter', 
         AUTHOR = 'J K Rowling',
         hasRead = false
         }
    ]


let books = [

        {
        
        TITLE = 'The Hobbit', 
        AUTHOR = 'J R R Tolken',
        hasRead = true
        },

        {
         TITLE = 'Harry Potter', 
         AUTHOR = 'J K Rowling',
         hasRead = false
         }
         ]

show book title & author of each book

FOR LOOP
set counter = 0;
as long as counter is LESS THAN the ARRAY LENGTH
INCREMENT counter by 1

print BOOK TITLE / AUTHOR


         FOR ( counter = 0  counter < array.length counter++){
            print BOOK TITLE / AUTHOR
         }

       for( let counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++ ){
             console.log( BOOK TITLE / AUTHOR );
       }



Depending on whether or not I have read book, show the
folowing message:

You have already read BOOK TITLE by AUTHOR

You have not read BOOK TITLE by AUTHOR


(let books are 2 objects)
